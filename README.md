# Bubble-Sort-Algorithm-

This project implements bubble sort, a simple sorting algorithm, to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

Functionality:

-Sorts an integer array using bubble sort. Prints the sorted array to the console.


Benefits:

-Easy to understand and implement. Good for educational purposes.


Limitations:

-Less efficient for large datasets (O(n^2) time complexity).
